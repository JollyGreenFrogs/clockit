## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Weak Default Secret Key
**Risk Level:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Business Impact:** SEVERE

**Issue:** The application uses a predictable default secret key for JWT token signing, which could allow attackers to forge authentication tokens and gain unauthorized access to any user account.

**Impact:**
- Complete authentication bypass
- Unauthorized access to all user data
- Potential data theft or manipulation
- Regulatory compliance violations (GDPR, SOC 2)

**Remediation Time:** 5 minutes  
**Cost to Fix:** Low (configuration change)

### 2. Insufficient Password Complexity
**Risk Level:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Business Impact:** HIGH

**Issue:** Password requirements are minimal (6 characters only), making accounts vulnerable to brute force attacks and credential stuffing.

**Impact:**
- Easy account compromise
- User data exposure
- Reputational damage
- Potential liability for data breaches

**Remediation Time:** 10 minutes  
**Cost to Fix:** Low (code change)

---

## High-Priority Issues

### 3. Missing HTTPS Enforcement
**Risk Level:** 🟠 HIGH  
**Business Impact:** HIGH

- Credentials transmitted in clear text
- Session hijacking possible
- Man-in-the-middle attacks feasible

**Remediation Time:** 15 minutes  
**Cost to Fix:** Low (infrastructure configuration)

### 4. Hardcoded Database Credentials
**Risk Level:** 🟠 HIGH  
**Business Impact:** HIGH

- Credentials visible in version control
- Easy database access for attackers
- Compromise of all application data

**Remediation Time:** 10 minutes  
**Cost to Fix:** Low (configuration change)

### 5. Exposed Database Port
**Risk Level:** 🟠 HIGH  
**Business Impact:** MEDIUM

- Direct database access from internet
- Bypasses application security layer
- Increases attack surface

**Remediation Time:** 2 minutes  
**Cost to Fix:** None (configuration change)

---

## Positive Security Findings

The audit also identified several strengths:

✅ **Strong Password Hashing** - Uses industry-standard bcrypt  
✅ **No Known Vulnerabilities** - All dependencies are up-to-date  
✅ **SQL Injection Protection** - Proper ORM usage  
✅ **User Data Isolation** - Multi-tenant architecture  
✅ **Container Security** - Non-root execution, minimal images  
✅ **Account Lockout** - Protection against brute force  
✅ **Audit Logging** - Authentication event tracking
