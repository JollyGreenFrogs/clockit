# TODO

We are going to move the application into the cloud. The aim will be to have two options for data storage for the user.

1. Store their data in the cloud using a database which is hosted by Jolly Green Frogs (JGF). This will be our cloud enviroment
2. Store their data locally on their machine using a local database which the app will connect to each time they login.

## Features

### Refactoring and Code Quality Improvements

1. Clean the repo up removing any redundant code.
2. Refactor the code to make it more modular and easier to maintain.
3. Add comprehensive comments and documentation to the codebase.
4. Add detailed logging and log storage to support debugging and monitoring.
5. Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
6. Move the forntend to a modern framework such as React or Vue.js.

### New Features

1. User Authentication: Implement a secure login system that allows users to choose between cloud storage and local storage options.
2. Hosted (Cloud) Storage. Setup a database using postgres or mysql for storing the data online
3. Local Storage: Integrate a lightweight database like SQLite for local data storage on the users machine.
4. Extend the existing features of the application
5. Further enhance the multi currency support
6. Enable exporting the invoices in multiple formats as well as allow the user to export to link to their Quickbooks account.
7. Setup warning message for when users forget to stop the timer. Use a machine learning model to detect when the user is likely to have forgotten to stop the timer.
8. Enable messaging using either browser, email, sms or WhatsApp to remind users to stop the timers.
9. Implement a backup and restore feature for local data to prevent data loss.
