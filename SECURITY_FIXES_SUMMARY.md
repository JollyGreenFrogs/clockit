## Fixed Issues

### CRITICAL Priority (100% Complete)

#### ✅ CRITICAL-001: Weak Default Secret Key
**Status:** FIXED  
**Impact:** Complete authentication bypass prevented

**Changes Made:**
- Removed weak default SECRET_KEY fallback (`"your-secret-key-change-in-production"`)
- Added runtime validation requiring SECRET_KEY environment variable
- Enforces minimum 32-character length for security
- Application now fails to start if SECRET_KEY is not properly configured
- Enhanced config validation with production-specific checks

**Files Modified:**
- `src/auth/services.py`: Removed default fallback, added validation
- `src/config.py`: Added SECRET_KEY validation logic
- `.env.example`: Added guidance for generating secure keys
- `scripts/generate-secrets.sh`: Created script for secure key generation

**Verification:**
- ✅ Application fails gracefully when SECRET_KEY is missing
- ✅ Application rejects SECRET_KEY shorter than 32 characters
- ✅ Tests pass with properly configured SECRET_KEY

#### ✅ CRITICAL-002: Insufficient Password Complexity
**Status:** FIXED  
**Impact:** Brute force attacks significantly harder

**Changes Made:**
- Increased minimum password length from 6 to 12 characters
- Added complexity requirements:
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- Added checks for common patterns:
  - Sequential numbers (4+ digits: 1234, 5678)
  - Repeated characters (4+ times: aaaa, 1111)
- **Enhanced with comprehensive password blocklist:**
  - Loaded from `src/auth/data/common_passwords.txt`
  - Contains 150+ known weak/common passwords
  - Based on security research (SecLists, HaveIBeenPwned, NCSC)
  - Cached in memory for fast lookups (O(1) performance)
  - Updatable via `scripts/update-password-list.sh`
  - Falls back to basic list if file is missing

**Files Modified:**
- `src/auth/services.py`: Added `validate_password_strength()` function with file-based password list
- `src/auth/data/common_passwords.txt`: Curated list of weak passwords (new)
- `src/auth/data/README.md`: Documentation for maintaining the password list (new)
- `scripts/update-password-list.sh`: Script to update password list (new)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Weak passwords rejected (tested with "123", "password", "abc123")
- ✅ Strong passwords accepted (tested with complex passwords)
- ✅ Common password variants blocked ("Password123!", "Welcome123!")
- ✅ Password list loads correctly from file
- ✅ Cache mechanism working (150 passwords loaded)
- ✅ All authentication tests passing

- Removed all hardcoded credentials from `docker-compose.yml`
- Updated to use environment variables (`${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}`, `${SECRET_KEY}`)
- Created secure secret generation script
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent committing `.env` files
- Added comprehensive documentation

**Files Modified:**

The application is now production-ready with proper security controls in place. However, ongoing security maintenance and monitoring are essential to maintain this security level.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ 100% of CRITICAL issues resolved
- ✅ 100% of HIGH priority issues resolved

- ✅ 0 CodeQL security alerts
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation provided
